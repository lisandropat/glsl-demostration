# GLSL Demostration [![GitHub license](https://github.com/lisandropat/glsl-demostration/blob/master/LICENSE)
GLSL usage demostration, using a JS library to load shaders from web galleries (not to load 3D objects).

## So...

In order to start learing the basics of GLSL, I load shaders using this tool, maybe it's useful to some others :)
